Get Some Data!
==============

This is a collection of scripts to get some (hight dimensional) data. You can use it if your day is very boring, you want to visualize some senseless things or if you plan to do some serious research.

Of course you can just go to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) and download some data sets. But hand crafted data from sources you know are just better, because you got (really?) some knowledge about the structure and the meaning of the data.

Usage
-----

Just browse through the directories to see how to get some data.
